** Food-Bridge**
  A digital platform that connects food donors with those in need, reducing food waste and fighting hunger

**Problem Statement:**
    Food wastage and hunger persist due to the lack of an efficient system connecting surplus food providers with those in need. Existing donation processes face logistical inefficiencies, limited tracking, and accessibility issues, leading to wasted resources. A digital platform is needed to streamline food donation, enhance coordination, and promote social responsibility.

**Description:**
    Food wastage and hunger are two interconnected global issues that persist due to inefficient food distribution systems. While millions of tons of food are discarded daily by households, restaurants, and businesses, a significant portion of the population suffers from food insecurity. The absence of a structured, real-time mechanism to connect surplus food providers with those in need leads to unnecessary waste and missed opportunities for hunger relief.
  
  Existing food donation efforts often lack coordination, transparency, and accessibility, making it difficult for donors to contribute effectively and for recipients to receive timely assistance. Logistical challenges, such as transportation and food safety concerns, further hinder the efficient redistribution of surplus food.
  
  There is a pressing need for a digital platform that facilitates the seamless collection and distribution of excess food, optimizes resource utilization, and encourages a culture of responsible food sharing.

**Project Title: ** 
  **  SAM – Share-A-Meal **

## **Solution**  

  **SAM (Share-A-Meal)** is a digital platform that connects food donors—such as restaurants, individuals, and businesses—with recipients like NGOs, shelters, and underprivileged communities. The platform ensures efficient food redistribution, reducing waste and addressing hunger through:  
  
  - **Real-time food listing** by donors.  
  - **Seamless request tracking** for recipients.  
  - **Optimized logistics support** for food pickup and delivery.  
  - **Transparency & accountability** in the donation process.  
  
  By leveraging technology, **SAM** streamlines food donation, promotes social responsibility, and helps create a sustainable, hunger-free society.


**Tech Stack**
